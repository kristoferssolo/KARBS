# Kristofers Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Script (KARBS)

## Installation

On an Arch-based distribution as root, run the following:

```shell
curl -LO kristofers.xyz/karbs.sh
sh karbs.sh
```

That's it.

## What is KARBS?

KARBS is a script that autoinstalls and autoconfigures a fully-functioning
and minimal terminal-and-vim-based Arch Linux environment.

KARBS can be run on a fresh install of Arch or Artix Linux, and provides you
with a fully configured diving-board for work or more customization.

## Customization

By default, KARBS uses the programs from [here](pkg-files/minimal-pkgs.txt) and installs
[my dotfiles repo (solorice)](https://github.com/kristoferssolo/solorice).
