# Kristofer's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Scripts (KARBS)

## Installation

On an Arch-based distribution as root, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/kristoferssolo/karbs
cd karbs
sh karbs.sh
```

That's it.

## What is KARBS?

KARBS is a script that autoinstalls and autoconfigures a fully-functioning
and minimal terminal-and-vim-based Arch Linux environment.

KARBS can be run on a fresh install of Arch or Artix Linux, and provides you
with a fully configured diving-board for work or more customization.

## Customization

By default, KARBS uses the programs [here in packages](pkg-files/minimal-pkgs.txt) and installs
[my dotfiles repo (solorice) here](https://github.com/kristoferssolo/solorice).
